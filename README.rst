Source code of the official Django tutorial
===========================================

* Link: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/
* Django version: 1.4

I made it because the tutorial could be a reference one day and I did not want to go through all of it again.
Thus, it can be used as a "cheatsheet".
However, for beginners, I strongly recommend to go through the tutorial by yourself at least once.



Steps (run within django-tuto/mysite)
--------------------------------------

1. manage.py syncdb
2. manage.py runserver


Optional - Set up the time zone
--------------------------------

If you do not want to wonder why the dates do not match your local time, you should set up the time zone. 

The default value is the Central time zone in the U.S. (Chicago).
