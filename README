Source code of the official Django tutorial. (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/)
It can be use as a "cheatsheet" but I strongly recommend to go through the tutorial by yourself at least once.

Django version: 1.4
Steps (run within django-tuto/mysite):
1) manage.py syncdb
2) manage.py runserver

Optional - Set up the time zone: 
If you do not want to wonder why the dates do not match your local time, you should set up the time zone. The default value is the Central time zone in the U.S. (Chicago).
See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#std:setting-TIME_ZONE and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name
